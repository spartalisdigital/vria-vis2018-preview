_&lt;VRIA&gt;_ is **work in progress**, and is being developed as part of [Peter Butcher's](https://github.com/pbutcher) PhD.

### Features

Currently _&lt;VRIA&gt;_ supports 3D bar charts and multivariate scatter plots with more visualization types planned. Every _&lt;VRIA&gt;_ visualization component has a corresponding set of interaction components which can be configured in the visualization configuration file. New interactions can be written with A-Frame and React and added to your application with _&lt;VRIA&gt;_'s API.

With a number of enhancements planned, in the next phase we are looking to build more 3D visualization components, along with corresponding interaction mechanisms. We also plan to integrate features that allow collaborative tasks in VR space.

More details will be added shortly!
